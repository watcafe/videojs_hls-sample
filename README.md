# videojs_hls-sample
Sample for HLS with video.js

# Purpose
HLS for every modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari and so on.  
Activate transcript instead for captions.

# Components
[video.js](http://videojs.com/)  
[hls.js](https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js)  
[videojs-contrib-hls](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls)  
[video-js-transcript](https://github.com/walsh9/videojs-transcript)  
  
Once I tried [videojs-hlsjs](https://github.com/benjipott/videojs-hlsjs). However it didn't work well, why the combination it and videojs-transcript was not good. I encountered JS's error: cannot create track object.
